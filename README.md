- Reward tokens according to the time they were staked
- Set stake locking time
- Reward tokens according to the participation of each staker
- Proxy contracts to make them upgradeable
- Use DAO for creating new staking pools and approve changes on contracts
- Create farm pools (liquidity pools)
- Convert tokens to NFTs with random lock time and % rewards generation
- Create NFT staking pools
- Apply slither security fixes
